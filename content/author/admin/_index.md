I am an incoming Physics PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My primary research interests are
gravitational waves and multimessenger astronomy, including but not limited to:

- Detect and characterize GW sources
- Electromagnetic follow-up of GW sources
- Understand GW detectors

As a member of the [LIGO](https://www.ligo.org/) collaboration, I've worked with [Dr. Michael Coughlin](https://www.michaelwcoughlin.com/)
applied machine learning to characterize and subtract the non-linear noise coupling mechanisms in the LIGO detectors. 
At MIT, I will be working with the LIGO MIT data analysis group, under the supervision of 
[Dr. Erik Katsavounidis](http://www.mit.edu/~kats/) and [Prof. Salvatore Vitale](https://sites.google.com/site/follemente/).

In May 2019, I'll receive my BSc in Physics & Astronomy from the University of Rochester. As an undergradate, I worked
with [Prof. Segev BenZvi](https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~sybenzvi/) and [Prof. Regina Demina](http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~regina/)
on a variety of projects in supernova neutrino simulations, computational cosmology, and Type Ia supernova spectra classification.
